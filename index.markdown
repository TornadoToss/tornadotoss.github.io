# Hello! I'm Eryth.

I'm a Scottish games development student, currently undertaking my fourth year at Abertay University. 

I'm passionate about game dev from a technical standpoint, finding efficient and creative solutions to technical problems.
However, I also take lots of interest in the design aspect of games, and I enjoy analysing what makes games fun (or not!), carrying that knowledge forward into my own projects.

When I'm not developing games, I'm usually playing them! I'm a huge fan of kart racers and JRPGs. Besides that, I enjoy dabbling in music composition, and getting out into nature. 
Fresh air can do a programmer wonders.
